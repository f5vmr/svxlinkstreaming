First we need to determine that the correct svxlink is installed.
The user needs to be asked by whiptail to confirm that they have installed svxlink 
with svxlinkbuilder/svxlink Image 
If they say no then go to ## install 
## Wec Check that the correct Svxlink is installed and it is the acceptable
version by looking for [TxStream] anyway in the /etc/svxlink/svxlink.conf 
# If ![TxStream] report the version you have is not compatible
Darkice will be installed, but you will need to configure your version
of svxlink yourself. #Jump to ## Install. 
##configure
Here we created the darkice.cfg by copying the blank file 
first. 
sudo cp svxlinkstreaming/darkice.cfg /etc/
sudo cp svxlinkstreaming/darkice.service /etc/systemd/system/
Now add darkice.sh to scripts. and 
add line to sudo crontab -e @reboot /home/pi/scripts/darkice.sh
#query what URL have you for the public view of your stream?
#eg http://portal.svxlink.uk:8010/stream 
#NB Your port will be set at 8000.
## Install
Be aware the user will  be asked for three passwords by Icecast 1. Source 2. Relay 3. Admin
Install Darkice icecast2
When installing passwords in icecast2 we need try to grab the 'source' Password into a variable to swap with 'source'
for use in darkice.cfg, where there is a place holder source.
Once icecast2 is installed need to add a new line to /etc/default/icecast2
ENABLE=true
Now we need to change in /etc/svxlink/svxlink in [Tx1] Change TX=Tx1 to TX=MultiTx

Now we enable all the services 
sudo systemctl enable darkice icecast2 --now.
